I use Monte-Carlo policy gradient: REINFORCE to solve this problem. Baseline is n-step Sarsa with linear function approximation. The Google Colab link is https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ur7xOx6DeNWrhOkDGYhg5oDUlNu9zQL5?usp=sharing , you can find the final result figure of both algorithms in the end of the output module. 
The detailed descriptions of both algorithms are as follows:
